# MAVLink Java Playground
This is a small toy repository for experimenting with both
[dronefleet's MAVLink Java API](https://github.com/dronefleet/mavlink)
and [the official MAVLink Java SDK](https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Java)

## Prerequisites
It is assumed that an instance of SITL is running locally on TCP port 5760 as outlined
by the SITL guide [here](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/using-sitl-for-ardupilot-testing.html#connecting-other-additional-ground-stations)  

For setting up SITL, please refer to the root of the SITL guide
[here](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/SITL-setup-landingpage.html)
